/**
 * Creator fee-claim hook — `WithdrawCreatorFee` (tag 90).
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED AND WHY IT MATTERS
 * ───────────────────────────────
 * This hook used to display the market's `insurance_domain_budget` as the
 * creator's "claimable" balance and drain it with `WithdrawInsuranceAsset`
 * (tag 57). That budget is the LOSS BACKSTOP the engine draws down to cover
 * negative trader PnL (`consume_domain_insurance_for_negative_pnl`), and tag
 * 57's health gate only bites during active stress — so the button let a
 * creator preemptively remove the market's solvency backstop while it looked
 * healthy, and the number next to it was never creator revenue in the first
 * place.
 *
 * The deployed wrapper accrues the creator fee leg per asset, into
 * `AssetOracleProfileV16.creator_fee_claimable_atoms` (GH#420,
 * `a327b4b0`) — plus, for asset 0 only, whatever sits in the legacy
 * market-level counter that predates GH#420 (`WrapperConfigV16
 * .creator_fee_claimable_atoms`, u64 LE, config byte 568 / absolute 584).
 * `WithdrawCreatorFee` (tag 90) pays out exactly that sum for `assetIndex: 0`
 * and this hook mirrors it. Tag 90 cannot touch a domain budget and tag 57
 * cannot touch either counter — they are disjoint by construction. This hook
 * therefore:
 *
 *   1. reads the balance through `lib/v17-creator-fee.ts`, which delegates both
 *      decodes to the SDK's `parseWrapperConfigV17` / `parseAssetOracleProfileV17`
 *      so neither byte offset has more than one owner in this repo (app-local
 *      copies of layout constants going stale is what caused the 496→576
 *      outage, and reading only the legacy counter is what caused the frontend
 *      to under-report post-GH#420 fees, percolator-prog#507);
 *   2. gates on asset 0's `asset_admin` and ONLY that — deliberately NOT
 *      `insurance_operator` (re-gated on-chain 2026-07-23) nor `marketauth`. The
 *      wizard's full create flow rotates `marketauth`, `insurance_authority` AND
 *      `insurance_operator` to program PDAs; `asset_admin` is the sole field that
 *      stays the creator's wallet, so it is the only gate that leaves a staked
 *      market claimable by its creator (and what the on-chain handler accepts);
 *   3. builds + sends the 17-byte tag-90 instruction and re-reads the account
 *      so the displayed claimable drops after a successful claim.
 *
 * SHAPE: this hook only ever targets asset 0 — the claim flow hardcodes
 * `assetIndex: 0` (`lib/creator-fee-claim-ix.ts`) — so there is still no
 * per-asset breakdown surfaced here even though the on-chain accrual is now
 * per-asset. A multi-asset market's assets 1..N accrue their own claimable
 * balances that this hook does not read or expose.
 *
 * NO COOLDOWN: tag 57's `insurance_withdraw_cooldown_slots` / ceiling gates
 * exist to rate-limit backstop withdrawals. `handle_withdraw_creator_fee`
 * deliberately has neither (see its doc comment, divergence #2) because the
 * counter is disjoint from the backstop. Surfacing a cooldown here would block
 * legitimate claims for a gate the program does not apply.
