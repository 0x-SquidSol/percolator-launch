/**
 * Effective (current) leverage of a position on its cross-margined portfolio.
 *
 *   leverage = position notional / portfolio equity
 *   notional = |size| x mark          (size is engine Q, POS_SCALE 1e6)
 *   equity   = capital + pnl          (collateral atoms)
 *
 * This is a LIVE figure, not entry leverage. Percolator stores no entry
 * leverage on chain (PortfolioV17 has capital / pnl / legs with basisPosQ +
 * ADL snapshots, and no entry price or leverage field — see
 * lib/userAccountScan.ts portfolioV17ToAccount). The order-ticket slider value
 * is only remembered in localStorage (lib/entry-price.ts getEntryLeverage), so
 * it is never presented as the position's leverage here.
 *
 * Because margin is cross-portfolio, the number moves with the mark price and
 * with the PnL / collateral changes of any other position sharing that margin.
 *
 * NOMINAL size, deliberately: ADL shrinks a leg's exposure without rewriting
 * its basis and the engine still charges margin on the basis, so the effective
 * (reduced) exposure would understate leverage — the unsafe direction for a
 * risk readout (same rule as lib/margin-health.ts).
 *
 * Collateral is treated as USD-pegged (the app's convention everywhere:
 * notional USD == collateral units), scaled by `collateralDecimals`.
