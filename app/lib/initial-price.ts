/**
 * Resolving a market's opening price, and saying why when we can't.
 *
 * The create wizard blocks launch behind `oraclePriceValid`, whose failure
 * message is always "Waiting on price feed". That message was wrong in two
 * different ways, and both of them stranded the user on a spinner with no way
 * forward:
 *
 * 1. THE PRICE RESOLVED, BUT TOO SMALL TO REPRESENT. `initialPriceE6` reaches
 *    the chain as a raw E6 integer with no decimal scaling, so the smallest
 *    non-zero price a market can carry is 1e-6 USD. A token trading below
 *    5e-7 — routine for pump.fun memecoins — rounds to 0, fails the non-zero
 *    gate, and reports a feed problem even though the feed answered correctly.
 *    Nothing the user waits for can ever fix that.
 *
 * 2. A GOOD PRICE WAS OVERWRITTEN WITH NOTHING. Two independent sources feed
 *    this: `/api/oracle/resolve/[mint]` (the wizard's `adminPrice`) and the
 *    DEX pool scan (`config.initialPrice`). `adminPrice` can be null while the
 *    pool price is perfectly good, and the wizard then assigned the null over
 *    it. The route reaches that state two ways: a non-ok response or timeout
 *    (the common one), and a 200 carrying `price: 0`, which is reachable only
 *    for the hardcoded MINT_TO_PYTH mints — everything else 404s when no
 *    source has a price. The 200 case is also cached for 5 minutes, so for
 *    those mints it is sticky rather than intermittent.
 *
 * Hence two exported pieces: one that merges the sources without ever
 * downgrading to nothing, and one that converts to E6 while distinguishing
 * "no price yet" from "this price cannot be represented".
