/**
 * The slippage limit a matcher close (TradeCpi) is sent with on a v17/v18 market.
 *
 * Built from the engine's `effective_price` (AssetStateV16, decoded by
 * lib/limits/decode.ts) — the price the fill settles at and the matcher prices exec
 * from — never from the site feed. Left to useTrade, a close got a FEED-derived limit:
 * refused outright by the GH#2525 gate once feed and chain disagreed >2%, and even
 * ungated a short's close (buy at feed x 1.05) sat below the fill whenever the feed ran
 * low, so it reverted. Not markEwmaE6 either: the keeper mark can lead effective_price by
 * far more than the band during a catch-up. An explicit limit skips useTrade's feed gate,
 * which only guards feed-derived limits. A bad feed must never trap a user in a position.
