/**
 * The order ticket's leverage control — bounds, quantisation and presets.

 * GH#2628. This lived inline in OrderTicket's JSX, which made it untestable:
 * the only way to assert on it was to re-implement it in a test file and hope
 * the copy stayed in step, which is the pattern that let three defects sit in
 * fifteen lines of it —
 *
 *   1. the typed input ran through Math.round, so "2.5" became 3 — a 20%
 *      leverage increase the trader did not ask for and was not told about,
 *      and always in the riskier direction because Math.round breaks ties
 *      upward;
 *   2. the slider stepped by 1, so no fractional value was reachable by
 *      dragging either;
 *   3. the snap-to-preset reduce was seeded with `raw`, so |best - raw| started
 *      at 0, no candidate could ever beat it, and the snapping never fired.
 *
 * Fractional leverage is not an edge case here: markets are created in 0.5
 * steps (GH#2621), and a market's own maximum is derived to two decimals.

 * A typed leverage, quantised to what the control can represent.

 *
 * On the DIRECTION, because the obvious argument is wrong for this control:
 * "more leverage is a closer liquidation" is true of a margin-first ticket, and
 * this one is size-first. The trader enters a size; margin is derived as
 * notional/leverage and the position size comes back out as margin*leverage, so
 * SIZE — and therefore the liquidation price, which is computed against the
 * account's whole collateral — is invariant to leverage here. What leverage
 * actually moves is how much collateral gets RESERVED. Rounding down reserves
 * more, which is the conservative direction but can trip the `exceedsBalance`
 * gate on an order a rounded-up value would have allowed. Flooring is still the
 * right default (it never silently gives a trader a number they did not type),
 * but it is not the safety property the first version of this comment claimed.
 *
 * Non-finite input returns the minimum rather than throwing or propagating NaN;
 * the caller's `isNaN` guard means this is belt-and-braces, but this function is
 * exported and should not depend on its caller checking first.

 * the keystroke that typed the dot rewrote the box as "2" and erased it; the
 * next digit appended to "2" instead of "2.", producing "25", which the clamp
 * pulled to the market maximum. Typing 2.5 on a 20x market selected 20x.
