/**
 * Telling "we did not record this" apart from "this is zero".
 *
 * The trades panel reported **Fees Paid: 0**. The trader paid a fee on every
 * fill — 20 / 10 / 5 bps depending on the market — and the indexer simply does
 * not know the amount: `extractFeeFromTransfers` is deliberately neutered
 * (#153) because deriving the fee from the trader's SOL delta was recording
 * collateral movements as fees. `trades.fee` is 0 on every row, the panel
 * summed it, and presented the sum as a fact.
 *
 * Volume has the same shape and is quieter about it. `total_volume` is
 * `size × price`, and `price` is 0 wherever the slab's post-state was missing
 * from the payload (`extractPriceFromLogs` is neutered too, #150 — the log
 * scan was a price-poisoning vector). Those rows contribute nothing, so the
 * headline understates by whole trades rather than by a rounding error.
 *
 * This is the #2556 pattern again: an absent value rendered as a definite one.
 * The rule here is the same — say "unknown" when it is unknown, and let the
 * figure start reporting itself the moment a backfill populates the column.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT done: reconstructing the fee client-side. It is computable
 * in principle (`notional × fee_bps`), but `fee_bps` is not in the indexer's
 * ParsedFill on `main` or on `feat/v18-wire-migration`, and inventing a number
 * the indexer refused to invent would repeat the mistake #153 exists to stop.
