/**
 * GET /api/chart/[mint]?timeframe=hour&aggregate=1&limit=24[&before=<unixSeconds>]
 *
 * Fetches OHLCV candle data directly from GeckoTerminal's public API (no key
 * required). Optional: set COINGECKO_API_KEY (+ COINGECKO_API_TIER=demo|pro) to use
 * the authenticated CoinGecko on-chain API instead — see lib/gecko-fetch.ts (#2578). This route used to proxy to percolator-api's GET /chart/:mint,
 * but that Railway service is down/deprecated ("Application not found") —
 * every trade-page chart rendered empty axes because the proxy target no
 * longer exists. GeckoTerminal fetch now lives here instead, mirroring the
 * pattern already used by the 24h-stats fallback (see
 * geckoTerminalStatsFallback in app/api/prices/[slab]/route.ts) and the logo
 * resolver (app/api/token-logo/[mint]/route.ts).
 *
 * Resolution:
 *   1. GET /networks/solana/tokens/{mint}?include=top_pools — resolve the
 *      mint's most-liquid pool (highest reserve_in_usd among the returned
 *      `included` pool objects).
 *   2. GET /networks/solana/pools/{pool}/ohlcv/{timeframe}?aggregate=&limit=
 *      [&before_timestamp=] — fetch candles for that pool. GeckoTerminal
 *      returns rows newest-first; we reverse to ascending (oldest → newest)
 *      for the chart.
 *
 * `before` (optional, unix SECONDS, integer): scroll-back paging (#2581).
 * GeckoTerminal's OHLCV endpoint accepts `before_timestamp` and pages straight
 * past the single window this route used to fetch — two requests retrieve a
 * token's ENTIRE history back to pool creation. Validated as a plain digit
 * string before being forwarded; an invalid/missing value is silently treated
 * as "no paging" (page 1) rather than erroring, matching how `aggregate`/
 * `limit` already degrade. It also joins the cache key below — without that,
 * page 2 would be served page 1's cached bars.
 *
 * Degrades gracefully on any failure (no pool found, upstream error, bad
 * data): returns `{ candles: [], poolAddress: null }` with a 200 status so
 * the client's oracle-price fallback (useTokenChart / TradingChart) still
 * has something to draw instead of erroring out.
 *
 * Response: { candles: CandleData[], poolAddress: string | null, cached: boolean }
