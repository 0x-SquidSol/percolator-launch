/**
 * isMarketauthComplete — the completeness signal the on-chain-discovery markets
 * path uses to hide markets that never finished the create-market wizard.
 *
 * A market is complete once percolator-stake InitPool (the wizard's final
 * on-chain step) has rotated `marketauth` from the creator's wallet to the
 * stake-pool PDA. So `marketauth == derive("stake_pool", slab)` proves it ran;
 * a market that died mid-creation still has `marketauth == creator wallet` and
 * must read as incomplete so the list filter hides it.
 *
 * The SDK's `deriveStakePool` and the config's `vaultProgramId` (which becomes
 * the module-level STAKE_PROGRAM_ID) are mocked so the test controls the
 * expected PDA without a chain/PDA computation.
