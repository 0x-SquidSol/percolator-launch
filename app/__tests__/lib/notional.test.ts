/**
 * GH#2616 — the single definition of position notional.
 *
 * These assert EXACT bigint equality. The component test that came first could
 * not: the modal never renders the notional, only `formatLeverage(notional /
 * accountEquity)`, and `formatLeverageValue` is `toFixed(1)`. With its fixture
 * any notional in [425_100_000, 475_000_000] printed "0.9x" — a +5.3% error
 * passed all four of its tests. Review proved that with a mutant that simply
 * added 24 Sim-USDC to the result.
