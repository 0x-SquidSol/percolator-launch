/**
 * Nobody is told where a trading fee goes.
 *
 * `FeeSplitControl.tsx` would have shown it and is never rendered, so a
 * creator does not know they earn a share, an LP never sees the 48% behind
 * Earn's yield, and a staker is told they earn 0% with nothing to compare it
 * against.
 *
 * These pin the numbers to the SDK rather than restating them, so a protocol
 * change fails a test instead of quietly turning the UI into a lie.
