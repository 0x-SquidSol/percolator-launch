/**
 * Final wrapper (3245e861): CloseResolved reaches 204k CU and 101 SettleVaultLpResolved 285k.
 *  - every exit tx asks for the SUM of its steps' budgets (>= 300k per CloseResolved-class step,
 *    >= 400k... per 101 is covered by 320k + the 20k base; a lone 101 tx gets 340k >= 300k) and
 *    batches never exceed the 1.2M cap (three 101s used to share one fixed 600k tx);
 *  - the resolved-exit pre-send simulation carries the cap (a bare simulation gets the 200k default);
 *  - the own-portfolio cleanup (CloseResolved + ClosePortfolio) keeps 600k.
