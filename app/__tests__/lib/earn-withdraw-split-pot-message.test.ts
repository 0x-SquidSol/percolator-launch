/**
 * Earn LP-vault WITHDRAW split-pot message (issue: ExecuteRedemption Custom(25)).
 *
 * An UNBOUND Earn vault whose backing is split across the market's two sides
 * (domains) refuses a large redemption in percolator-prog handle_execute_redemption
 * with the engine's generic `EngineCounterUnderflow` (Custom 25) — the
 * `principal_portion > ledger.total_principal_atoms` gate (v16_program.rs). Confirmed
 * on devnet by simulating the real stuck redemption on SI (8WC8…): the payout is
 * priced on the COMBINED two-pot principal (1.6B + 1.0B = 2.6B) but drawn from one
 * pot (1.6B), so a redeemer holding ~100% of shares is short by ~1000 USDC.
 *
 * A BOUND vault names this VaultLpRedeemNeedsRecall and auto-repairs
 * (senior-draw-repair.ts); an UNBOUND vault has no recall path, so the error used to
 * fall through to "Something went wrong and nothing was sent." on a money screen where
 * nothing was actually sent. This pins the fix: an honest, non-alarming message on the
 * withdraw surface ONLY, with the code scoped so every other surface keeps the generic
 * internal-fault message.
