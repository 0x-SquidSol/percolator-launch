/**
 * The trades panel reported "Fees Paid: 0" for a trader who had paid a fee on
 * every fill.
 *
 * `trades.fee` is 0 on every row by design — the indexer's fee extraction is
 * deliberately neutered (#153) — so summing it always yields 0, and the panel
 * presented that as a fact. Volume has the same shape: trades with no recorded
 * price contribute nothing, so the headline understates by whole trades.

 * See lib/trade-stats-display.ts.
