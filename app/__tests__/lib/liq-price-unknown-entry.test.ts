 * #2673 item 3 — "describeLiqPrice shows a price before consulting
 * hasResolvedEntry, so on the unknown path the Liq cell is fabricated from the
 * mark-as-entry." Checked against the engine's own accounting: it is not.
 *
 * Engine (v16.rs:9382-9437, see resolveEntryPrice's doc): a solvent loser's
 * realized loss is moved OUT of capital and pnl is pushed back to 0. Equity
 * (capital + pnl) is unchanged; only the attribution to an entry is lost. The
 * exact liquidation price depends only on equity:
 *     long:  C + s·(P − E) = m·s·P   ⇒   P* = (E − C/s) / (1 − m)
 * and (E, C) → (mark, C + pnl) leaves E − C/s unchanged. So the unknown path's
 * (entry = mark, crystallized capital) is the same equity reference as the
 * derived path's (entry = mark − pnl/s, original capital).
