/**
 * GH#2628 — the order ticket's leverage control.
 *
 * Three defects in fifteen inline lines of JSX:
 *
 *  1. the typed input ran through Math.round, so "2.5" became 3 — a 20%
 *     leverage increase the trader did not ask for, always in the riskier
 *     direction because Math.round breaks ties upward;
 *  2. the slider stepped by 1, so no fractional value was reachable;
 *  3. the snap-to-preset reduce was seeded with `raw`, so |best - raw| started
 *     at 0, no candidate could beat it, and the snapping never fired.
 *
 * The first version of these tests RE-IMPLEMENTED the control, because inline
 * JSX cannot be imported — the "mirrors page logic" pattern that let three
 * defects sit there unnoticed. The logic is extracted now, so these import the
 * real thing and the anti-drift source scan that PoC needed is gone.
