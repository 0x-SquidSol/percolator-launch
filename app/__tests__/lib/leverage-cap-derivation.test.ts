/**
 * GH#2621 — the dial's bounds must TRACK @/lib/market-params, not merely equal
 * it today.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole defect: 6.5 was a private copy that stayed
 * behind when the thing it came from changed. `expect(MAX_LEVERAGE).toBe(
 * MAX_LEVERAGE_X)` cannot see it — both are 10 at runtime.
 *
 * My first attempt at closing this asserted on source text, matching
 * `export const MAX_LEVERAGE = MAX_LEVERAGE_X;` after stripping comments. It was
 * defeated in one line — delete the name from the import and add a local
 * `const MAX_LEVERAGE_X = 10;`, and the regex still matches while the binding is
 * now a private copy. It also produced FALSE FAILURES: the stripper cut lines at
 * the first `//`, so an ordinary `https://` URL anywhere in the file deleted the
 * export from the text being searched, and the trailing `\s*;` could not span an
 * `as const`.
 *
 * Mocking the module is the real check. If the dial imports the constant, its
 * exports move when the mock moves. If it has its own copy, they do not. No
 * source scraping, no stripper, no false failures.
