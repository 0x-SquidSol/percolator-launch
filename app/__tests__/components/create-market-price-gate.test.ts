/**
 * Binds the price fix to the source.
 *
 * `__tests__/lib/initial-price.test.ts` covers the rules, but all the
 * interesting logic here is the WIRING: which field each branch prices from,
 * which dependencies re-run the effect, and what gets cleared on a token
 * change. A pure-helper suite cannot see any of that — reverting
 * CreateMarketWizard.tsx entirely leaves every one of those tests green.
 *
 * Same technique, and the same reason, as create-market-launch-gate.test.ts.
