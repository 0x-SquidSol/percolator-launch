/**
 * The market launch has a fast path that signs all seven transactions in ONE
 * wallet approval. When it fails before broadcasting anything, it silently
 * falls back to signing six times.
 *
 * The fallback itself is correct — nothing is on chain, so the sequential path
 * is safe. What was wrong is that it threw the REASON away:
 *
 *     } catch (err) {
 *       if (!broadcastStarted) {
 *         return { status: "fallback" };   // err never used
 *       }
 *
 * The batch has several unrelated ways to throw before broadcast — a non-2xx
 * from the devnet pre-fund, a keeper co-sign failure, an airdrop that did not
 * confirm — and from the outside they are indistinguishable. The only symptom
 * was a user signing six times, on any wallet (reproduced on both Phantom and
 * Solflare), with nothing anywhere saying why.
 *
 * The hook half of this is pinned in
 * __tests__/hooks/useCreateMarket-batch-fallback-wiring.test.ts — without it,
 * reverting the hook left this file green and the feature dead.
 *
 * See #2586.
