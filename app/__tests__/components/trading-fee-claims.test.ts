/**
 * The create page told creators their market's trading fee was "the same on
 * every market". It is not — the fee is derived from the token's liquidity
 * tier (20 / 10 / 5 bps), and that value is what reaches the chain.
 *
 * These pin the CLAIMS, because the defect is a claim. A fee readout that
 * states a policy the code does not implement is worse than one that states
 * nothing: a creator reads it, believes their market matches every other, and
 * is wrong.
 *
 * The policy itself was real — `FIXED_TRADING_FEE_BPS` was declared with
 * "one rate for every market" — but it was never wired to anything. Rather
 * than implement it (a pricing decision, not a bug fix), the claims are
 * corrected to describe what actually ships.
