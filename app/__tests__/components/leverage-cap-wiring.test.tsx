/**
 * GH#2621 — what the creator's dial actually offers, asserted on the RENDERED
 * control rather than on the exported constants.
 *
 * The first version of these tests was a pure unit test over two numbers and two
 * pure functions. It never rendered StepControlRoom, so review reintroduced the
 * entire bug with one-line edits that left it 9/9 green:
 *
 *   max={MAX_LEVERAGE}  ->  max={6.5}                       the dial stops at 6.5x again
 *   max={MAX_LEVERAGE}  ->  max={MIN_LEVERAGE}              the dial collapses to one point
 *   onChange={(v) => onMarginBpsChange(leverageToMarginBps(v))}
 *     -> onMarginBpsChange(Math.max(1500, leverageToMarginBps(v)))
 *                                                           WORSE than the original bug:
 *                                                           shows 10x, writes 1500 bps
 *
 * The converters were well covered; the wiring between them and the control was
 * not covered at all. These close that.
