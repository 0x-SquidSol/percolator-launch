/**
 * Binds the #2629 keep-on-unknown fix to the source.
 *
 * /api/devnet-airdrop used its own local sendAndConfirmSignedTx, which threw a
 * GENERIC error on poll-timeout — indistinguishable from a real failure — and the
 * `finally` released the 24h claim on any !mintSucceeded, so a slow-but-landed mint
 * let a retry double-airdrop. The sibling routes (devnet-pre-fund #2599,
 * playground/faucet #2602) distinguish a definite failure (release the claim) from
 * an unknown/timeout outcome (KEEP it) via ServerSignatureTimeoutError.
 *
 * A behavioural test would have to drive the route's local confirm through its
 * hardcoded 45s timeout (un-mockable without a refactor), so this asserts on the
 * WIRING — the same reason create-market-price-gate.test.ts reads source. The
 * behaviour of the shared keep-on-timeout path itself is covered by
 * devnet-pre-fund-claim-release.test.ts.
